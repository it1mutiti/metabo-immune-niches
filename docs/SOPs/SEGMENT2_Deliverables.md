# SEGMENT 2 ‚Äî Reproducibility Infrastructure Deliverables

**Project:** Metabo-Immune Niches  
**Segment:** 2 ‚Äî Project Infrastructure & Reproducibility  
**Status:** Completed ‚úÖ  
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Author:** Irvine

## 1. Overview

Segment 2 establishes a deterministic, auditable, and platform-independent computational environment for the entire Metabo-Immune Niches pipeline.  
It includes frozen environments, provenance tracking, cryptographic manifests, runtime audit trails, and a single-command reproducibility pipeline (`make segment2`).

## 2. Core Deliverables

### üß± Environment Snapshots
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `environment/python_env.yml` | Symlink to latest Python environment export |
| `environment/python_env_<timestamp>.yml` | Immutable Conda environment archive |
| `environment/renv_<timestamp>.lock` | R package lockfile from `renv::snapshot()` |
| `renv.lock` | Active lockfile (mirrors most recent snapshot) |

### üß¨ Provenance & Integrity
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `manifests/raw_data_hashes.txt` | SHA-256 hashes for `data/raw/` |
| `manifests/external_data_hashes.txt` | SHA-256 hashes for `data/external/` |
| `manifests/data_manifest.json` | Machine-readable manifest with file paths, hashes, and sizes |
| `results/logs/ReproMetadata.json` | Host, OS, git commit, conda env, and model metadata |
| `results/logs/command_history.log` | Chronological Bash command log |
| `results/logs/R_command_history.log` | Timestamped R expression and error log |

### üîÅ Cross-Language Bridge & Verification
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `scripts/utils/freeze_bridge_test.R` | Validates R‚ÜîPython reticulate bridge |
| `results/logs/bridge_test.log` | Output log of bridge connectivity |
| `scripts/utils/verify_env_all.sh` | Unified reproducibility verifier |
| `results/logs/env_check_<timestamp>.txt` | Verification snapshots (environment state, logs, git status) |

### üß∞ Automation
| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `Makefile` | One-command reproducibility pipeline |
| Targets: | `make freeze`, `make provenance`, `make verify`, `make segment2` |

## 3. Execution Summary

Run:
```bash
cd ~/metabo-immune-niches
make segment2

---

## Validation Proof

The following verification artifacts cryptographically seal the Segment 2 reproducibility state.

**Verification log:**  
`results/logs/env_check_20251025_173153.txt`

**SHA-256 checksum (deterministic proof):**  
`f97fc2b36b5826ca7ac48ce3e2b5c836209acca4bdb917bac0dd1e3b81a2266e`

**Purpose:**  
This checksum uniquely identifies the environment verification snapshot generated on 2025-10-25.  
Any future execution of `make segment2` that reproduces the same hash confirms byte-for-byte immutability of the computational environment, guaranteeing deterministic reproducibility across platforms and time.
